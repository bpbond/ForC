382,Lugo_1992_cott,ANPP,ANPP was calculated by adding tree biomass increment and litterfall during the period of measurement. Aboveground tree biomass was estimated allometrically using tree inventory data and biomass-diameter relation
383,Lugo_1992_cott,ANPP,"ANPP was calculated by adding tree biomass increment and litterfall during the period of measurement. Pine, mahogany, and roble (Tabebuia heterophylla (DC.) Britton) trees were harvested to supplement available biomass information on these species. Least squares regression analysis was used to develop bio- mass-diameter relation"
408,Uhl_1984_sand,ANPP,litter collection
433,Weaver_2001_ntfc,ANPP,ANPP was estimated by summing annual litterfall accumulation (897 g/m2/year) plus biomass change due to delayed mortality (142 g/m2/year) plus estimated herbivory (25 g/m2/year)
434,Kadeba_1991_abpa,ANPP,ANPP is mean periodic aboveground production plus mean annual litterfall
435,Uhl_1987_fcsf,ANPP,ANPP was calculated by combining litter (leaf+branch) and growth data (allometric relations based on height and diameter).
